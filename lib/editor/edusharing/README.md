edu-sharing editor plugin
=========================

The edu-sharing editor plugin adds the option to embed all kinds of edu-sharing content to all WYSIWYG fields. The new button will open the edu-sharing search engine and let you pick an item embed. Audio and video-files will be embedded with a player. Documents will be represented by a link. You may pick which version of the content you would like to provide in the course (always the latest vs. the version you just picked).

Dependencies
